        <h2><u>Pokémon Unite is:</u></h2>
        <p>A pay-to-win game that makes your eyes rot in hell and die and extinguish, but it still is a super fun game, 
            unfortunately. It is a free-to-play, multiplayer online battle arena video game developed by TiMi Studio Group 
            and published by The Pokémon Company for Android and iOS and by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. 
            It was announced in a Pokémon Presents presentation on 24 June 2020. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch
             on 21 July 2021, and was released for Android and iOS in 73 countries on 22 September 2021. As of August 2022,
              the game has been downloaded over 80 million times across all platforms.

            Pokémon Unite is a multiplayer online battle arena game, with standard matches consisting of two teams, 
            each with 5 players. Each match is limited to 10 minutes in duration, and the team with
            the highest total score by the end of each match wins.[7] A team can also win if the opposing
            team surrenders. Surrendering can only happen if the match reaches the halfway mark, and if a majority vote 
            among the team members is reached. If there is a tie, the team that scored 
            the tied score first wins. There are limited time maps, and a game mode called Quick Battle,
            which is five minutes long with four players (sometimes 3) on each team. 
            The Quick Battle game mode has different maps, each with some changes to the rules, 
            size of map and species of wild Pokémon temporary event maps.
