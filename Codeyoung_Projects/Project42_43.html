            the opposition from scoring. The main objective in cricket is to score as 
            many runs as possible against the opponent. Before the match begins, the captain of 
            both teams will toss a coin, with the winner of the toss being able to decide 
            which team bats and fields first. We have a mixed boys and girls team.
