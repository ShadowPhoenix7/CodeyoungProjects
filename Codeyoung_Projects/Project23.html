        <p>Finland began working to kick-start its domestic wood industry a full 30 years ago. 
           Rules on how high you could build in wood were amended to allow for a greater variety 
           of designs. And even 10 years ago, there was little talk about climate footprints, explains
           Teemu Halme, architect at Anttinen Oiva Arkkitehdit in Helsinki. 
           
           The initial idea was to make the most of domestic timber production.
           But over the past five years, climate footprint has also become a major consideration.
           And so in 2012 building contractor SRV and wood products firm Stora
           Enso joined forces with the City of Helsinki and a competition was 
           launched to build a whole city block mostly in wood. Today there are many
           examples of tall wooden buildings, not least Sara Kulturhus in Skellefte√•, 
           which rises up 20 storeys and is made from locally produced wood. 
           However, back then the new district was set to be not just the biggest wood project in Finland,
           but at eight floors, it would also be the biggest in Europe.
